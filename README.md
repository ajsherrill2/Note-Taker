# Note-taker

## Description

In this Project I was tasked with creating a note taker application that runs on Heroku CLI using node.js, express.js and Javascript. This takes addvantage of using a local server to store json data captured from the users input as they save notes to the note taker app, I learned to create my own api and html requests and incorperate routers.
